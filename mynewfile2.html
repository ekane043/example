		<h2>Luther and my goals</h2>
			<p> The main goal for my attending Luther is to get a degree. Simple enough. I want to major in computer science and Biology
			but from what I can tell that is one goal that may be a little to much for me to accomplish but I'm goin all in. Biology 
			is coming back to me easy enough the only thing I hate is we have to take math I'm not exactly great at math. 
			But it counts for both cs and bio. Computer Science is proving to be time consuming but I really love the hands on learning.
			I learned how to do most of this stuff from trial and error and asking the professor what to do every once in a while.
			I have a feeling this will be a great four years at Luther if I stick with it. In college I only have to take one math class
			and let it be known that I hate math with a passion and I would rather die than take two math classes. That being said I am willing
			to take one math class but I will not like it at all.</p>
