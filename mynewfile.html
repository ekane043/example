		<h3> World of Tanks</h3>
			<p> World of tanks is my favorite game it's a first person shooter where you drive different tanks from the WW2 era.
			The game is fun because it uses team strategy, armor angling, and a lot of fire power to win. My favorite types of tanks
			were the German tanks because they usually had weaker armor but they had a fast gun reload and did good damage.</p>
		<h3> StarCraft II</h3> 
			<p> Starcraft was a blast, it had the overview 3rd person look where you controlled armies and had to get objectives. 
			I loved the campaign to death in the first game and the add-on. I however was absolutely terrible in the multiplayer area.
			Everyone I played online would slay me before I could even have my base up.</p>
		<h3> Day of Defeat</h3>
			<p> Day of Defeat is a first person shooter that is baseed entirely online. I love this game for the fact that fighting
			other humans in the real world without actually hurting them. My play style was simple just charge in and spray and pray.
			Wasn't much strategy for me just run at the enemy and shoot. I loved playing this because I could play with my dad and
			brother at the same time and have a blast.</p>
